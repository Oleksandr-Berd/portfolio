Portfolio Website Challenge
Welcome to my portfolio website project! In this project, I have built a multi-page portfolio website that showcases my projects and skills. This website is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. I have utilized the provided designs to create a visually appealing and interactive portfolio.

Interactive Elements: Interactive elements throughout the site have hover states, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.
Smooth Scroll: Clicking the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage smoothly scrolls down to the next section, improving user experience.
Contact Form Validation: The contact form validates user input and displays appropriate error messages if required fields are empty or if the email address is not formatted correctly.
